# Crowdfunding_ETL
Crowdfunding data utilizes the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) methodology to accurately study the data.
This technique allows you to clean the data, compartmentalize it appropriately in the columns for easier visual of the data, and allows you to perform an analysis quickly.
I used Jupyter notebook along with Pandas, numpy, and also utilized SQL database to load the data and then store and manage it. Finally, I made the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to provide a visual representation by using "Quick Database Diagrams" website. 
Looking at the data, it can be noted that the Theater category has the highest rate and Journalism and Games had the lowers rate. 
The Theater categoy also had the highest pledged amounts which were higher than $15 million. Categories such as Film and Video, Music, Publishing, and Technology also rated higher than Journalism and Games. 
It can also be noted that United States, Canada, and UK had the highest sum of pledged amounts to support crowdfunding in their countries compared to other countries.
